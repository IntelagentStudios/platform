# ðŸ§­ Intelagent Chatbot Setup Flow Guide

This is the official setup logic followed by the Setup Agent. It defines the expected user steps and how the chatbot should respond.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Collect and confirm the user's domain
- Validate their license key using database lookup
- Generate a unique site key for their chatbot
- Present the embed code using that key
- Store site key + domain in the database

---

## ðŸ§  Memory Keys Used

| Key                | Description                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `domain`           | User's provided website domain               |
| `domain_confirmed` | Boolean â€” has the user confirmed the domain? |
| `license_key`      | User's provided license key                  |
| `license_valid`    | Boolean â€” has the license been validated?    |
| `site_key`         | Unique key for their chatbot                 |

---

## âœ… Step 1: Greet the User

- Agent introduces itself as a Setup Agent
- Politely asks the user to provide their website domain (e.g., `mystore.com` or `mystore.myshopify.com`)

---

## âœ… Step 2: Confirm the Domain

- Agent repeats the submitted domain back to the user
- Waits for explicit confirmation (user must reply "yes" or similar)

---

## âœ… Step 3: Request License Key

- Once domain is confirmed, agent asks for license key
- Explains format: INTL-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
- Mentions it was sent in purchase email

---

## âœ… Step 4: Validate License Key

- Agent uses PostgreSQL tool to check license validity
- Queries licenses table for matching active license
- If valid: proceeds to site key generation
- If invalid: asks user to check key or contact support

---

## âœ… Step 5: Generate Site Key

- Only after successful license validation
- Agent generates a placeholder site key
- The system automatically replaces this with a real, secure key
- The domain + site key are stored in the `site_keys` database table
- License is marked as used

---

## âœ… Step 6: Display Embed Code

- Agent shows the user their chatbot embed code:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.intelagent.chatbot/widget.js" data-site="[SITE_KEY]"></script>
```Explains how to install it (in the website's HTML before the closing </body> tag)


âœ… Step 7: Offer Support
If the user has questions, the agent provides help with:

Installation guidance
Troubleshooting
Where to paste the embed code


ðŸ§  Behavior Summary

If domain not stored â†’ Ask for domain
If domain exists but not confirmed â†’ Ask for confirmation
If domain confirmed but no license â†’ Ask for license key
If license provided but not validated â†’ Use PostgreSQL tool to validate
If license invalid â†’ Ask user to check key
If license valid â†’ Generate site key and show embed code


ðŸ›  Technical Implementation
License Validation:

Setup Agent receives license key from user
Agent uses PostgreSQL tool to query licenses table
Tool checks: license_key exists AND status = 'active' AND subscription_status = 'active'
If validation passes, agent proceeds to site key generation

Site Key Generation:

Agent generates placeholder key format: key_[16_random_chars]
Site Key Generator node detects license validation
Real site key is generated and stored in database
License is marked as used with domain association


ðŸ”’ Security Features

License Validation: Every setup requires valid, active license
One-time Use: Licenses cannot be reused after site key generation
Domain Locking: Site keys are tied to specific domains
Active Status Check: Only active subscriptions can generate site keys
