# Intelagent Platform - Comprehensive Project Status and Goals

## Executive Summary

The Intelagent Platform is a sophisticated AI-powered business automation system built on a revolutionary skills-based architecture. The platform features **310 modular skill workflows** orchestrated by **8 intelligent management agents**, enabling businesses to automate virtually any job role or business process.

**Current Status**: Core infrastructure operational with authentication, product management, and complete skills framework with 310 skills. Successfully transitioned to skills-matrix architecture with 8 management agents while maintaining existing live services (particularly the chatbot). Management system fully integrated into admin dashboard with real-time data from all agents. Chatbot dashboard enhanced with improved UX, topic categorization, and clickable links. Stripe payment integration complete and live in production. Custom Agent Builder API route implemented with enterprise tier validation. Recent fixes include sidebar navigation improvements, theme color consistency, database schema corrections, and standardized authentication for both Harry's (INTL-AGNT-BOSS-MODE) and James's (INTL-NW1S-QANW-2025) accounts. 

**Strategic Pivot**: Transitioning from tiered pricing to modular product architecture where base products (Chatbot, Sales Outreach, Onboarding) can be customized for specific business needs, with optional Platform upgrade for intelligent system integration and custom agent builder for completely bespoke solutions.
